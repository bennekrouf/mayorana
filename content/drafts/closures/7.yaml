# Multi-line research notes using block scalar
research_context: |
  When returning a closure that captures variables (especially references), you must ensure the captured data outlives the closure. Rust enforces this through lifetime annotations and ownership rules. Hereâ€™s how to handle it:
  Key Strategies

      Use move to Transfer Ownership
      Force the closure to take ownership of captured variables, eliminating dependency on external lifetimes:
      rust

  fn create_closure() -> impl Fn() -> String {
      let s = String::from("hello"); // Owned data
      move || s.clone() // `move` captures `s` by value
  }

  Annotate Lifetimes for Captured References
  If capturing references, explicitly tie the closureâ€™s lifetime to the input data:
  rust

  fn capture_ref<'a>(s: &'a str) -> impl Fn() -> &'a str {
      move || s // Closure's output tied to `'a`
  }

  Avoid Returning Closures Capturing Short-Lived References
  Closures capturing references to local variables cannot escape their scope:
  rust

      // ERROR: `s` does not live long enough!
      fn invalid_closure() -> impl Fn() -> &str {
          let s = String::from("hello");
          move || &s // `s` dies at end of function
      }

  Example: Safe Lifetime Management
  rust

  // Correct: Closure owns the captured data
  fn safe_closure() -> impl Fn() -> String {
      let s = String::from("hello");
      move || s // `s` is moved into the closure (owned)
  }

  // Correct: Closure tied to input reference's lifetime
  fn capture_with_lifetime<'a>(s: &'a str) -> impl Fn() -> &'a str + 'a {
      move || s // Closure's lifetime matches `s`
  }

  Lifetime Pitfalls

      Dangling References:
      Returning a closure that captures a reference to a local variable will fail:
      rust

  fn dangling_closure() -> impl Fn() -> &str {
      let local = String::from("oops");
      move || &local // ERROR: `local` dies here
  }

  Elision Ambiguity:
  Use explicit lifetimes when the compiler canâ€™t infer relationships:
  rust

      // Explicitly annotate input and closure lifetimes
      fn process<'a>(data: &'a [i32]) -> impl Fn(usize) -> &'a i32 + 'a {
          move |i| &data[i] // Closure tied to `data`'s lifetime
      }

  Key Takeaways

  âœ… Use move to transfer ownership of captured variables.
  âœ… Annotate lifetimes when closures capture references.
  ðŸš« Avoid returning closures that capture short-lived references.

  Real-World Use Case:
  In web frameworks like actix-web, handlers often return closures capturing request data with explicitly managed lifetimes.

  Try This: What happens if you remove move from capture_with_lifetime?
  Answer: Compiler error! The closure would try to borrow s, which doesnâ€™t live long enough.
