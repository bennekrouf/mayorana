# Explain Rust's approach to concurrency. How do ownership and borrowing prevent data races?

Rustâ€™s concurrency model leverages its ownership and borrowing rules to guarantee thread safety at compile time, eliminating data races without requiring a garbage collector. This approach ensures safe, high-performance parallelism with minimal runtime overhead.

## Rustâ€™s Concurrency Model

Rust uses the following mechanisms to manage concurrency:
- **Ownership**: Ensures exclusive mutable access to data.
- **Borrowing**: Governs how data is accessed via references.
- **Lifetimes**: Prevent dangling references across threads.
- **Send/Sync Traits**: Define which types are safe for threading.

## How Ownership and Borrowing Prevent Data Races

A **data race** occurs when:
- Two threads access the same data concurrently.
- At least one access is a write.
- Thereâ€™s no synchronization.

Rustâ€™s rules make data races impossible in safe code:

### 1. Exclusive Mutability (`&mut T`)
- Only one mutable reference (`&mut T`) can exist at a time, enforced by the borrow checker.
- This prevents multiple threads from writing to the same data simultaneously.

**Example**:
```rust
let mut data = 0;
let r1 = &mut data;  // OK: Mutable borrow
// let r2 = &mut data;  // ERROR: Cannot borrow `data` as mutable more than once
```

### 2. No Shared Mutability Without Synchronization
- Shared references (`&T`) are read-only, safe for concurrent access.
- To mutate shared data, synchronization primitives like `Mutex` are required:

**Example**:
```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

let shared = Mutex::new(42);
let guard = shared.lock().unwrap();  // Exclusive access
*guard += 1;  // Safe mutation
```

## Thread-Safe Types: Send and Sync

- **Send**: A type can be safely transferred across threads (e.g., `String`, `Mutex<T>`).
- **Sync**: A type can be safely shared between threads via references (e.g., `&i32`, `Arc<T>`).

**Example: Spawning Threads**:
```rust
use std::thread;

let value = String::from("hello");  // `String` is `Send`
thread::spawn(move || {             // `move` transfers ownership
    println!("{}", value);          // Safe: no other thread can access `value`
}).join().unwrap();
```

## Common Concurrency Tools

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Thread Safety Mechanism** |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| `Mutex<T>` | Mutual exclusion | Locks for exclusive access |
| `Arc<T>` | Atomic reference counting | Shared ownership across threads |
| `RwLock<T>` | Read-write lock | Multiple readers or one writer |
| `mpsc channels` | Message passing | Transfers ownership between threads |

**Example: Shared State with Arc + Mutex**:
```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
let mut handles = vec![];

for _ in 0..10 {
    let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
    handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
        *num += 1;  // Mutex ensures exclusive access
    }));
}

for handle in handles {
    handle.join().unwrap();
}
println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());  // Outputs 10
```

## Why This Matters

- **No runtime overhead**: Safety checks occur at compile time.
- **No garbage collector**: Safe concurrency without GC pauses.
- **Fearless parallelism**: The compiler rejects unsafe patterns, enabling confident concurrent programming.

## Key Takeaways

âœ… **Ownership rules prevent**:
- Concurrent mutable access (no data races).
- Dangling references (via lifetimes).

âœ… **Send/Sync enforce** thread safety at compile time.

ðŸš€ **Use `Mutex`, `Arc`, or channels** for safe shared state.

**Real-World Impact**: Crates like `rayon` (parallel iterators) and `tokio` (async runtime) rely on these guarantees for robust concurrency.

**Experiment**: What happens if you try to share an `Rc<T>` across threads?  
**Answer**: Compile error! `Rc<T>` is not `Send` (not thread-safe). Use `Arc<T>` instead.
