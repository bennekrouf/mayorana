# How does ownership prevent memory leaks and data races?

Ownership is Rust's core memory management system, enforcing strict rules at compile time to ensure safety without a garbage collector. It prevents memory leaks and data races through a combination of ownership rules, move semantics, and borrowing.

## Ownership in Rust

- Each value has a **single owner** (variable).
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value is **dropped** (`Drop` trait called).
- Ownership can be **transferred** (moved), making the original variable invalid.

## Key Rules

### Move Semantics

Assigning a heap-allocated value (e.g., `String`) to another variable transfers ownership, invalidating the original.

**Example**:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1; // Ownership moved to s2
// println!("{}", s1); // Compile error: value borrowed after move
```

### Copy vs. Move

- Types with **known size** (`i32`, `bool`) implement `Copy` and are cloned automatically.
- Heap-allocated types (`String`, `Vec`) do not implement `Copy` and are moved.

### Function Calls

Passing a value to a function moves or copies it, following the same rules.

**Example**:
```rust
fn take_ownership(s: String) { /* ... */ }

let s = String::from("hello");
take_ownership(s); // Ownership moved into the function
// println!("{}", s); // Error: s is invalid
```

## How Ownership Prevents Memory Leaks

- **Automatic Cleanup**: When the owner goes out of scope, Rust calls `drop` to free memory (no manual `free()` needed).
- **No Double Frees**: Since only one owner exists, the value is dropped exactly once.

## How Ownership Prevents Data Races

- **Borrowing Rules**:
  - **Immutable borrows** (`&T`): Multiple allowed, but no mutable borrows can coexist.
  - **Mutable borrows** (`&mut T`): Only one allowed, and no other borrows can exist.
- **Compile-Time Enforcement**: The compiler rejects code that could lead to data races.

**Example: Data Race Prevention**:
```rust
let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3];

let r1 = &data; // Immutable borrow OK
let r2 = &data; // Another immutable borrow OK
// let r3 = &mut data; // ERROR: Cannot borrow as mutable while immutable borrows exist

println!("{:?}, {:?}", r1, r2);
```

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Ownership ensures**:
- No dangling pointers (via lifetimes).
- No memory leaks (via `Drop`).
- No data races (via borrowing rules).

Rust’s ownership model guarantees memory safety and concurrency safety at compile time, delivering performance and reliability.
