If you're new to Rust, this guide will help you get started with the basics.\n\n## Setting Up Your Environment\n\nFirst, you'll need to install Rust on your system. The easiest way is to use rustup, the Rust toolchain installer:\n\n```bash\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n```\n\nThis command will download a script and start the installation process. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the installation.\n\n## Your First Rust Program\n\nLet's create a simple \"Hello, World!\" program. Create a new file called `hello.rs` with the following content:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, World!\");\n}\n```\n\nTo compile and run this program, use the following commands:\n\n```bash\nrustc hello.rs\n./hello\n```\n\n## Understanding Cargo\n\nCargo is Rust's build system and package manager. It handles many tasks such as building your code, downloading libraries, and building those libraries.\n\nTo create a new project with Cargo:\n\n```bash\ncargo new hello_cargo\ncd hello_cargo\n```\n\nThis creates a new directory called `hello_cargo` with the following structure:\n\n```\nhello_cargo/\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src/\n    └── main.rs\n```\n\nThe `Cargo.toml` file contains metadata about your project and its dependencies. The `src/main.rs` file contains your application code.\n\nTo build and run your project:\n\n```bash\ncargo build   # Compile the project\ncargo run     # Compile and run the project\n```\n\n## Key Concepts in Rust\n\n### Variables and Mutability\n\nBy default, variables in Rust are immutable:\n\n```rust\nlet x = 5;\n// x = 6; // This would cause an error\n```\n\nTo make a variable mutable, use the `mut` keyword:\n\n```rust\nlet mut y = 5;\ny = 6; // This works fine\n```\n\n### Ownership\n\nOwnership is Rust's most unique feature and enables memory safety without garbage collection. The main rules are:\n\n1. Each value in Rust has a variable that's its owner.\n2. There can only be one owner at a time.\n3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2, s1 is no longer valid\n    \n    // println!(\"{}\", s1); // This would cause an error\n    println!(\"{}\", s2); // This works fine\n}\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you have the basics, try building a small project to practice your skills. The Rust documentation is an excellent resource for learning more:\n\n- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)\n- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)\n\nHappy coding with Rust!",
