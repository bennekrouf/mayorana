Prompt for Natural French Translation:
"Translate this technical content to French with a natural, conversational tone. Avoid formal/academic language and AI-sounding adjectives. Use:

Direct, casual phrasing (Ã§a, pas de, etc.)
Natural contractions and everyday expressions
Keep technical terms in English when they're standard in the French tech community (ownership, borrowing, garbage collector)
Translate code comments naturally but keep short expressions like 'OK', 'Safe' as-is
Use 'tu' form when addressing the reader implicitly
Keep the same structure and formatting
Sound like a French developer explaining to another French developer

Avoid: overly formal translations, literal word-for-word conversion, pompous adjectives, academic terminology when simpler words work."
